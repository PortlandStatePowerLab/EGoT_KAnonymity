What is a channel in imgs?
	* number of colors in img

how do you learn kernels (filters)?
	*altered version of back prop


CNN use filters to learn features.
	* CNNs are good at detecting edges in images

CNNs, mathmatically, they do a transformation into another space.
	* They do a clusterning by the end of a this transformation

	* goal is to reduce the number of connections
	* you are also reudcing the total number of parameters

cross-correlations & autocorrelations

look into slide (convo vs cross vs auto correlation) (review it)

CNN has the trait of params sharing
	* also have another trait called sparse connectivity


CNNs are immune to translations
	* translating the imgs does not affect the performance of a CNN because of pooling. How??
	* CNNs ,however, are not immune to scaling or rotation or reflections. It cannot perform the smae

pooling is a function that takes a summary statstics of neighboring outputs

figure out how we ended up with 55X55 out of a 224x224 image using 11x11 kernels
	* minute 46 into today's lecture

using (smaller/larget) kernel sizes produce less features to use in the FC layer
