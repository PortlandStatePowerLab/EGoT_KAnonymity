does basic_mondrian writes results directly to file?
What are they passing to the mondrian funciton?
    * what is the attr_tree?
    * how would it look like if I used categorical cols instead?
    * does it take more than one QI ?
    * How would it look like if K = 3?




How do I create a suppresion model (tree) for basic mondrian?
